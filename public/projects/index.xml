      <description>The original version of my personal portfolio is a static site developed using HTML, CSS and Javascript with no additional features. The site was developed both as a personal project and for my intro to web development class at community college.&#xA;While the repository is archived, the latest version is still available on github pages, and can still be viewed below.&#xA;(Note: The original portfolio will be placed here once the issue is resolved.</description>
