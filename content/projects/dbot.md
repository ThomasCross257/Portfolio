# Introduction
Developed for Software Engineering during my time at university, D-Bot exists to act as an Open-Source template for modern discord bots utilizing newfound slash commands.

# Organization

The project consisted of 5 Software Engineers, Assistant Project Manager & Project Manager.

# Early efforts
As one of the Software Engineers, I took on the role as lead of backend development and began developing the bot's initial commands and functionality, as well as implementing designs and the concepts for viewing user levels, API integration, Database Schema design, and deployment to Heroku.

# Management changes.
Later on in development, I recused myself from actively developing and acted in the role of the Assistant Project Manager due to difficulties with managing the team.

I resolved many issues, including managing a distant developer and attempting to include them in our meetings through any way possible. Furthermore, I was also one of the main presenters, alongside the new head of backend development.

# Results
Project ended up receiving an A, tied in second place with another project in the same class. Third highest overall across both sections of Software Engineering.
