The IT checkout system developed  during my time as a Student Assistant was created in response to the large volume of MacBooks suddenly coming into our possession after a lab was refitted with new hardware.

Seeing as they were still usable and we were facing budget constraints, I developed this simple flask site in hopes of making it easier for us to rent out laptops and keep track of them outside our normal database system.
