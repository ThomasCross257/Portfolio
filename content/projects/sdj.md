# Introduction

Sailor's Daily Jill was originally conceptualized as an attempt to create a basic social media blogging site meant for viewing and consuming blog posts created by users.

This site was more of a means to an end, however, as the main feature involved its dockerization and eventual deployment to a kubernetes cluster of four Single Board Computers.

This was my first introduction to the realm of DevOps and the CI/CD pipeline. Future plans were made to integrate more content, yet due to university time-constraints, this content was cut.
